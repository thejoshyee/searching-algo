# About this Assignment
In this course, you have learned about text as a data structure, string searching algorithms, trie data structure, and methods for compressing texts. For this assignment, you will develop an application using the Java programming language.

# Prompt
The application must address the following requirements:

The application uses the names of 50 states in the United States as the input text.
It uses the bad character rule of the Boyer-Moore algorithm to search the pattern a user inputs via an interface.
When a user runs the application, it displays a menu and prompts the user to select an option.
The menu options are:
Display the text
Search
Exit program
When a user selects 1) Display the text, the application displays the content of the text (i.e. the names of 50 states in the United States).

When a user selects 2) Search, the application prompts the user to input a part of the name of a state as a pattern for search. The application searches for the pattern in the text using the bad character rule of the Boyer-Moore algorithm. Then, the application displays the indices of the matches (i.e. occurrences of the pattern in the text).

When a user selects 3) Exit program, the application ends.
